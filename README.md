## 🔍 Overview  
This project provides a simple Java implementation of a heap data structure — typically a binary min-heap or max-heap — built from the ground up.  
It demonstrates how elements can be inserted and removed in such a way that the heap property is maintained, and how such a structure can be used as a priority queue.

---

## ✨ Features  
- Implementation of a binary heap (min-heap or max-heap) using an array or list backing.  
- Core operations: `insert`, `extractRoot` (min or max), `peek`, `size`, etc.  
- Automatic resizing/growth of the backing structure if necessary.  
- Clear, instructional code structure suitable for educational purposes or small utility use.
